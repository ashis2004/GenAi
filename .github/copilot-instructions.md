# GenAI Repository Instructions

This repository contains comprehensive implementations of various Generative AI techniques and models. When working on this codebase:

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive variable names and function names
- Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions and classes
- Include type hints for better code readability
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code

## Project Structure
- Each major GenAI category has its own directory with implementations
- Jupyter notebooks should include markdown cells explaining concepts
- Include both educational examples and production-ready implementations
- Add performance benchmarks and evaluation metrics where applicable

## Documentation
- Document all model architectures and parameters
- Include training procedures and hyperparameters
- Provide clear setup and installation instructions
- Add references to research papers and sources

## Best Practices
- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Include error handling and logging in production code
- Add unit tests for critical functions
- Use GPU acceleration where available (CUDA/Metal)
- Implement proper data preprocessing and validation
