    "1. **Specialized medical knowledge processing** - Handling medical documents with appropriate chunking\n",
    "2. **Medical-domain embeddings** - Using embeddings optimized for medical text\n",
    "3. **Safe response generation** - Including disclaimers and safety warnings\n",
    "4. **Source attribution** - Providing clear citations for medical information\n",
    "5. **Evaluation framework** - Testing retrieval accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps for Production:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use medical-specific models** like BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, or BioGPT\n",
    "2. **Integrate real medical databases** such as PubMed, UpToDate, or medical textbooks\n",
    "3. **Implement robust safety measures** including emergency detection and appropriate warnings\n",
    "4. **Add human oversight** for sensitive medical queries\n",
    "5. **Ensure compliance** with medical regulations and privacy laws (HIPAA)\n",
    "6. **Regular updates** of the knowledge base with latest medical research\n",
